# webapp1
Simple demo of a web application written in HTML with some CSS.  This will be updated as time goes on.

This repo has no version numbers or anything, it's sort of a sandbox of HTML and CSS stuff to better
understand how web based scripting works.  I've worked a job prior to this, but was never privvy to
the details.  This will fix that lack of information.
