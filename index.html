            <p>Here are some facts:</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>While I'm not the best HTML developer, I did work for a company that used it a lot.</li>
                <li>I have experience coding in C, C++, Java, and many more languages!</li>
                <li>I'm mostly practicing for future work.  I spend a lot of time coding.</li>
                <ol type="A">
                    <li>I love how you can nest elements like this.</li>
                    <li>It makes HTML very interesting.</li>
                    <li>But I have no clue how one would can memorize this.</li>
                    <li>Practice makes perfect?</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Maybe when I retire, I'll become a painter.  Painters need:</li>

            <p>I want to put a nice picture here.</p>

            <p>Oh hey, it's my friend, Bob!</p>

            <p>Bob brought a friend!</p>

            <p class="formatStory" style="margin-left:10px">
                This is a wonderful story about a boy and his dog.
                Man's best friend, as it were.
                However, I forgot the story, so I'm just going to prattle on about something I know about I suppose.
                Did you know that there's an entire library one can use to find all sorts of interesting images used for image processing?
                In fact, the image next to this text is processed to look different than intended!
                That's pretty neat, isn't it?  <a href="https://sipi.usc.edu/database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can find it here. </a>
                Well, perhaps it's a little old-fashioned, but one must appreciate the tenacity of such an accomplishment.
                I wonder if you had to download all sorts of little packs just to make HTML work like it does today?
                I wonder what the licensing looked like.
                Wow, this is all so neat.
                Definitely an interesting change of pace from the usual C stuff I'm used to.  Perhaps I'll study as a webdev!
                Or not, who knows?
